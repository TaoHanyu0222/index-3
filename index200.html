     <h1>
       The music video for "The Station" was released on July 23, 2018.<br><br>
        It depicts two humanoid characters confronting each other in a dark and stylized cavernous pit. <br><br>
        A lavender-colored figure, chained at the neck, <br><br>
        makes their way to the other figure, who is rendered using an emboss filter and stuck in a crack in the cave wall.<br><br>
        They pull the embossed figure towards them,
        dragging into their back with their nails and leaving deep grooves in the embossed figure's flesh, who screams.<br><br>
        Wounds appear in the cave walls, black drops of fluid dripping out into a large mouth in the cave floor. <br><br>
        The lavender figure's chain is shown to be broken, <br><br>
        lying across the floor. <br><br>
        The embossed figure is now chained at the neck. <br><br>
        This chain pulls upward and becomes animalistic in appearance, <br><br>
        twisting and growing eyes. Sharp, embossed teeth enclose the picture. <br><br>
        Four images are framed surrounding an icon of an eye: the lavender figure loses grip between inflating walls of the cave, <br><br>
        their body distorts and breaks apart, the eyes on the chains cry black tears, and the tears splatter onto the face of the lavender figure. <br><br>
        The eye flashes rapidly before fading away, leaving an image of broken chains embedded in an organic-looking rock formation behind. <br><br>
        The picture pans upward to a broken chain which dangles just into the pit. <br><br>
        The narrative is unclear, but it can be deduced that the lavender figure was lowered into the pit by this chain, <br><br>
        which became broken. <br><br>
        Characteristics of the embossed figure are shared by the cave itself, <br><br>
        which implies the figure is an embodiment of the cave. <br><br>
        The embossed figure's assumption of the chain, <br><br>
        which then pulls upwards, <br><br>
        suggests that they intended to escape the cave. <br><br>
        However, neither figure is present when the video pans to outside the pit, <br><br>
        which implies neither of them escaped.<br><br>
